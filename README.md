# Communication_Network_CPP
This C++ program built in Sublime and run through the command line is passed a file with a message that is to be sent across a network. After running the program, a main menu will be displayed with a list of options. Typing a 1 and then pressing enter builds a basic network of 10 cities across the country. To add or delete a city on the network, enter a 4 or 5 respectively. Though the current network is usually displayed after any changes are made, entering a 2 will print the current network. Entering a 3 will transmit the message from the first city to the last city and back again one message word at a time. Finally, 6 will clear the network and 7 will exit the program.
